## Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Strategic Planning Platform

---

### 1. Executive Summary

Strategic planning is often slow, inconsistent, and dependent on manual effort from consultants and
internal teams. This leads to significant delays in project initiation and implementation,
especially when detailed documentation such as project plans, work breakdown structures, and risk
assessments are required.

The AI-Powered Strategic Planning Platform solves this problem by transforming high-level project
ideas into enterprise-grade planning documents using large language models and graph-based
reasoning. The core innovation is GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a system that
validates AI outputs against a domain-specific knowledge graph to prevent hallucinations and ensure
factual accuracy.

This platform reduces planning cycles from weeks to minutes while maintaining a <2% hallucination
rate and providing outputs that meet executive and operational standards. It is built to integrate
with common enterprise tooling such as GitHub, Jira, and cloud-native APIs. The platform will
support multiple user types, including strategic consultants, project managers, R\&D leads, and
technical engineers, with a strong focus on output quality, traceability, and deployment
scalability.

The AI Project Management Suite (AIPMS) is an enterprise-grade platform that leverages artificial
intelligence agents to transform project management through automation, assistance, and augmentation
of project management tasks. Building on insights from PMI research showing that 21% of
organizations are already using AI in project management and 82% of senior leaders expect AI to
significantly impact projects, AIPMS aims to dramatically improve project success rates (currently
only 35% globally) through intelligent automation and data-driven decision support.

### Key Value Propositions:

- **Increased Productivity**: Automate routine tasks, freeing PMs to focus on strategic activities
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Leverage predictive analytics and real-time insights
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and management of project risks
- **Resource Optimization**: AI-driven allocation and capacity planning

### 7. Technical Architecture

The architecture of the AI-Powered Strategic Planning Platform is modular, scalable, and optimized
for latency-sensitive AI operations. It separates responsibilities across frontend, orchestration,
data, and AI service layers to support rapid document generation, knowledge graph validation, and
enterprise integrations.

#### 7.1 Component Overview

- **Frontend Layer**  
   Built using **Nuxt.js 4** with **TypeScript** and **Vue 3**. Includes UI components for document
  creation, editing, graph visualization, task review, and export.
- **API & Orchestration Layer**  
   Powered by **FastAPI** using asynchronous execution. Hosts PydanticAI agents that orchestrate
  document generation, entity extraction, validation, and external API interactions (e.g., GitHub).
- **AI Services Layer**  
   Abstracts access to multiple LLM providers through **OpenRouter**. Uses both cloud and local
  models. Embeddings are generated using `text-embedding-3` models.
- **Graph Database Layer**  
   Managed **Neo4j** instance for real-time construction and validation of project-specific
  knowledge graphs. GraphRAG logic operates here for hallucination detection.
- **Relational Data Layer**  
   Uses **PostgreSQL** for structured storage of users, projects, PRDs, audit logs, and quality
  metrics. Includes Row-Level Security (RLS) via Supabase.
- **Authentication & Access Control**  
   Authenticated via Supabase Auth. Supports OAuth 2.0, SSO integrations, and multi-role RBAC
  enforcement.
- **Export & Integration Layer**  
   Converts planning data to PDFs, Markdown, DOCX, and GitHub project artifacts. GitHub integration
  includes milestone and issue creation, label mapping, and dependency linking.
- **Hybrid RAG** The Hybrid RAG system integrates Milvus (vector database) and Neo4j (graph
  database) to enhance information retrieval. Milvus stores and retrieves semantically similar
  document chunks using vector embeddings, enabling efficient similarity search. Neo4j manages the
  knowledge graph, capturing relationships and structured entities within the data. A query routing
  component dynamically determines whether to use Milvus, Neo4j, or both for retrieval based on the
  user query. Retrieved context from both sources is combined and passed to the LLM, which
  synthesizes an answer. Components include: (1) Document preprocessing and embedding generation,
  (2) Vector storage and search in Milvus, (3) Knowledge extraction and graph construction in Neo4j,
  (4) Routing and retrieval orchestration, and (5) Context aggregation and answer generation via the
  LLM. Example Components Overview : Milvus Vector Store: Stores document embeddings for fast,
  semantic similarity-based retrieval of relevant text chunks from unstructured data. Neo4j Graph
  Store: Manages a knowledge graph representing entities and their relationships to provide
  structured context and enrich answers with connected facts. Query Router: Analyzes the user’s
  question and decides whether to query Milvus, Neo4j, or both, optimizing for semantic similarity
  and relational context. Retriever/Orchestrator: Aggregates and combines results from both Milvus
  and Neo4j for the hybrid retrieval process. LLM Answer Generator: Consumes combined context to
  produce accurate, nuanced, final responses  
   Reference : @docs/013-milvus-neo4j-hybrid-rag.md

#### 7.2 Deployment Model

- Deployed in a containerized environment using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
- Stateless services scale horizontally (FastAPI, Nuxt.js).
- Stateful services (Neo4j, PostgreSQL) use managed cloud options with HA and backup support.
- CDN used for static assets and document downloads. (Cloudflare CDN)

### 10. Validation & Hallucination Prevention

This platform applies a multi-layered validation strategy using **GraphRAG (Graph-based
Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to reduce hallucinations and improve trust in AI-generated
documents.

#### 10.1 Validation Objectives

- Ensure factual accuracy of AI outputs.
- Enforce alignment with domain-specific requirements.
- Identify and mitigate hallucinated or unsupported content.
- Maintain source traceability for every generated statement.

#### 10.2 GraphRAG Validation Pipeline

The GraphRAG validation agent processes content through three hierarchical validation layers:

1. **Entity-Level Validation**
   - Checks whether individual claims match known entities in the knowledge graph.
   - Uses embedding similarity (>0.80) to match nodes.

2. **Community-Level Validation**
   - Validates whether groups of entities form coherent, semantically aligned communities.
   - Detects conflicting or contradictory clusters of concepts.

3. **Global Validation**
   - Confirms logical consistency, business rules, and policy alignment across the document.
   - Detects policy violations, formatting inconsistencies, and structural errors.

#### 10.3 Validation Confidence Scoring

```python
confidence_score = (
    entity_validation.score * 0.5 +
    community_validation.score * 0.3 +
    global_validation.score * 0.2
)
```

- Sections with `confidence_score < 0.95` are flagged for review or automatic correction.
- Sections with `confidence_score < 0.80` are excluded until verified.

#### 10.4 Source Traceability

- All claims in the PRD include references to their originating knowledge graph nodes.
- Each section contains a `provenance` field listing `requirement_id`, `source_text`, and
  `confidence`.
- Corrections log the original statement, revised version, reason, and model confidence.

#### 10.5 Auto-Correction Loop

If a section fails validation:

1. The GraphRAG Validator proposes a correction.
2. A domain-specific prompt reformulates the content.
3. Revalidated content is injected back into the PRD.
4. Human review is requested if score remains below threshold after two retries.

#### 10.6 Visualization & Review

- Users can toggle validation overlays on the PRD.
- Highlighted phrases show issues and confidence scores.
- A dashboard aggregates validation metrics across all projects.

### 11. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) feature transforms validated requirements into sequenced,
actionable engineering tasks. It allows for execution planning, effort estimation, and team
coordination based on AI-decomposed deliverables.

#### 11.1 Objectives

- Convert PRD requirements into atomic tasks.
- Sequence tasks using dependency analysis.
- Assign timelines and estimated effort per task.
- Identify the critical path for delivery planning.

#### 11.2 WBS Generation Workflow

1. **Requirement Extraction**
   - AI agent identifies implementation-relevant requirements.
   - Filters non-actionable content (e.g., general context).

2. **Atomic Decomposition**
   - Each requirement is broken into 1–2 day units of work.
   - Tasks include clear titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria.

3. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Uses graph relationships (e.g., `DEPENDS_ON`, `IMPLEMENTS`) to build a DAG.
   - Flags circular or missing dependencies.

4. **Effort Estimation**
   - Effort is scored using complexity and historical context.
   - Estimates range from 2–16 hours per task, with ±20% accuracy.

5. **Critical Path Calculation**
   - Identifies longest sequence of dependent tasks.
   - Used to calculate project timeline and delay impact.

6. **Output Formatting**
   - Generates JSON schema with task metadata.
   - Supports export to GitHub Issues and Gantt charts.

#### 11.3 Task Specification Schema

```python
class TaskSpecification(BaseModel):
    id: UUID
    title: str
    description: str
    estimated_hours: float  # range: 2 to 16
    complexity_score: int   # 1–10
    acceptance_criteria: List[str]
    dependencies: List[str]  # task IDs
    phase_id: Optional[str]
    validation_commands: List[str]
```

#### 11.4 Outputs & Views

- **Tabular View:** Tasks with time, complexity, and sequencing.
- **Graph View:** Visual DAG of task dependencies.
- **Timeline View:** Gantt-style chart of execution windows.
- **Export Options:** JSON, CSV, GitHub Issues, ZIP bundle.

#### 11.5 Quality Assurance

- Tasks must include ≥3 acceptance criteria.
- All dependencies must resolve to valid task IDs.
- Tasks without dependencies are flagged for review.
- Validation confidence ≥0.90 required for automatic GitHub export.

---

### 12. Quality Assurance Framework

The platform includes a built-in quality assurance (QA) system to ensure the generated planning
documents meet enterprise-grade expectations. This QA process combines algorithmic scoring,
rule-based validation, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

#### 12.1 Objectives

- Ensure clarity, completeness, and implementability of outputs.
- Automate quality checks to support scaling.
- Provide transparency and control over AI-generated content.

#### 12.2 Quality Metrics (4-Axis Scoring)

Each PRD is scored using the following metrics, normalized on a 1–10 scale:

| Metric                  | Description                                           | Weight |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Context Richness        | Depth of business, technical, and operational context | 25%    |
| Implementation Clarity  | Precision of tasks and requirements                   | 30%    |
| Validation Completeness | GraphRAG-backed confidence in outputs                 | 25%    |
| Success Probability     | Likelihood of implementation success                  | 20%    |

**Score Thresholds:**

- ≥8.0 — Auto-approved
- 6.0–7.9 — Manual review triggered
- <6.0 — Rejected with AI-suggested improvements

#### 12.3 QA Validation Pipeline

1. **Metric Evaluation**
   - Scoring engine evaluates each section.
   - Aggregated and weighted to overall quality score.

2. **Consistency Enforcement**
   - Checks formatting, section structure, metadata, and template alignment.

3. **Automated Revisions**
   - Uses AI to auto-rewrite or flag sections for low-scoring metrics.

4. **Human Review Workflow**
   - Review UI enables approval, rejection, or manual edits.
   - Each reviewer decision is logged in AuditLog.

#### 12.4 Quality Feedback Loop

- All rejections and edits feed into model fine-tuning pipeline.
- Reviewer comments are categorized and stored for pattern analysis.
- Anomaly detection flags unexpected drops in score trends.

#### 12.5 Observability

- Quality trends tracked across projects and teams.
- Exportable dashboards (via Supabase + Grafana or Metabase).
- Metrics used in executive reporting for platform effectiveness.
