2. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor API usage and implement buffering
3. **Error Handling**: Configure comprehensive error trapping and logging
4. **Test Environments**: Use separate environments for workflow testing

### Performance Optimization

1. **Artifact Management**: Clean up old artifacts to save storage
2. **Caching Strategy**: Cache dependencies between workflow runs
3. **Parallel Execution**: Use matrix strategies for independent jobs
4. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and resource limits

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Linting**: Maintain consistent ESLint/ESLint-TypeScript configuration
2. **Formatting**: Use Prettier with consistent formatting rules
3. **Testing**: Maintain >90% test coverage for workflow-critical code
4. **Documentation**: Keep all workflow and script documentation current

### Monitoring & Alerting

2. **Error Patterns**: Monitor for recurring failure patterns
3. **Cost Tracking**: Monitor API usage costs across all providers
4. **Performance Alerts**: Set up alerts for workflow timeouts or failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Missing API Keys
```bash
# Check available secrets
gh secret list

# Add missing API key
gh secret set OPENAI_API_KEY --body "$(cat ~/openai-key.txt)"
```

#### 2. Workflow Not Triggering
- **Check branch protection**: Ensure workflows run on protected branches
- **Verify workflow syntax**: Use GitHub's workflow validation
- **Check permissions**: Ensure appropriate repository permissions
- **Test with manual dispatch**: Use workflow_dispatch to test manually

#### 3. Dependency Update Failures
- **Check package versions**: Ensure compatibility with Node.js/Python versions
- **Review lock files**: Update package-lock.json and poetry.lock files
- **Test builds locally**: Run npm run build/test locally before committing
- **Update workflow paths**: Ensure correct directory paths for your project structure

#### 4. AI Analysis Timeout
- **Increase timeout**: Adjust TIMEOUT_MINUTES in workflow configuration
- **Reduce analysis scope**: Use basic/standard analysis instead of deep
- **Check API limits**: Monitor rate limits for your AI provider
- **Optimize prompts**: Simplify prompts for faster response times

#### 5. Permission Issues
```bash
# Grant workflow permissions
gh secret set GITHUB_TOKEN --body "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

# Check repository access
gh repo view --json owner,viewerCanAdmin

# Update workflow permissions
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  checks: read
```

### Error Recovery Procedures

1. **Restart Failed Workflows**:
```bash
# From GitHub Actions UI
# -> Actions tab -> Failed workflow -> Re-run workflows

# Or using CLI
gh workflow run WORKFLOW_NAME
```

2. **Redeploy Failed Commits**:
```bash
# Force push to trigger workflows
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI: fix"
git push
```

3. **Rollback Changes**:
```bash
# Create revert commit
git revert COMMIT_HASH
git push
```

### Log Analysis

1. **Download Workflow Logs**:
```bash
# See job commands section
gh run view <run_id> --job <job_id>
```

2. **Enable Debug Logging**:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

3. **Use SSH Debug**:
```yaml
# Add to workflow for SSH access on failure
- name: Setup tmate session
  if: failure()
  uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

1. **Minimale Exposure**: Use API keys only in required workflows
2. **Context-Aware Usage**: Configure keys per specific use case
