Based on the comprehensive research and analysis, I'll now create a revised Project Charter with a more realistic, grounded scope that leverages AI at its core while ensuring market-leading differentiation.

# Revised Project Charter: AI-Powered Strategic Planning Platform

## Executive Summary

This project charter defines the development of a **market-leading AI-powered strategic planning platform** that transforms project conceptualization into comprehensive, executable documents through intelligent human-AI collaboration. Based on current market analysis showing 72% of enterprise RAG implementations fail within their first year and the AI project management market growing at 16.91% CAGR to $14.45B by 2034, this platform addresses critical gaps with a realistic, phased approach.[1][2]

### Project Objective
To develop a **production-ready MVP** that demonstrates AI's transformative potential in project management through hallucination-free document generation, reducing planning cycles by 70% while establishing our organization as a leader in intelligent productivity tools.

## 1. Revised Business Case & Market Positioning

### Market Reality & Opportunity
The AI in project management market is experiencing rapid growth ($3.55B in 2025 to $14.45B by 2034), yet **72% of enterprise RAG implementations fail**. Our opportunity lies in delivering what others cannot: **reliable, production-ready AI** that actually works.[2][1]

**Key Market Insights:**
- Only 21% of project managers currently use AI regularly[3]
- 82% of senior leaders expect AI impact within 5 years[3]
- 75% of AI experts report improved delivery when properly implemented[4]
- Traditional RAG systems have 60% irrelevant result rates[5]

### Our Competitive Advantage
**GraphRAG-First Architecture**: Unlike competitors using traditional vector databases, we implement Microsoft's GraphRAG technology that reduces hallucinations by 95% and provides contextually-aware responses.[2]

**Market Differentiation:**
