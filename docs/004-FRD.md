# Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)

**Version:** 10.0 **Date:** June 25, 2025 **Author:** Jatinder Grewal **Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed enumeration of the functional requirements for the rhoSearcher
platform. Its purpose is to serve as the single source of truth for all stakeholders, including
developers, designers, and QA testers. The requirements are derived from the project's strategic
goals and are framed from a user-centric perspective through user stories.

## 2. Business Context and Strategic Goals

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Enterprise organizations struggle with knowledge fragmentation across disparate systems, leading to
significant operational inefficiencies. Teams spend an estimated 40% of their time searching for
information rather than performing high-value analysis. This is compounded by the inconsistent
accuracy of traditional search tools, the inability of manual research to scale with exponential
data growth, and the compliance risks associated with a lack of clear audit trails.

### 2.2 Business Objectives & Success Metrics

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Accelerate Decision-Making**: Reduce research time from hours to minutes through intelligent
   automation.
2. **Enhance Research Quality**: Improve accuracy and eliminate information blind spots through
   hybrid vector-graph retrieval and validation.
3. **Scale Knowledge Operations**: Support enterprise data volumes (100M+ documents) while
   maintaining consistent, high-speed performance.
4. **Ensure Enterprise Compliance**: Provide complete, immutable audit trails and source
   traceability to meet stringent regulatory requirements.

**Success Metrics:**

- 25% faster time-to-insight for complex research queries.
- 40% reduction in manual knowledge curation and requirements-gathering efforts.
- > 85% retrieval precision on benchmark datasets.
- 99.95% system uptime.

## 3. User Personas (Summary)

- **Sarah (VP of Sales):** Needs to quickly perform competitive and client-specific research. Values
  speed and verified sources.
- **David (Senior Paralegal):** Needs to conduct deep, accurate legal precedent and compliance
  research. Values accuracy and traceability.
- **Michael (Chief Strategy Officer):** Needs high-level market analysis and risk assessment. Values
  executive-ready insights with clear confidence indicators.
- **Project Manager/Team Lead:** Needs to define, plan, and manage projects efficiently. Values
  automation, predictive insights, and team health monitoring.
