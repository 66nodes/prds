### üó∫Ô∏è Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

#### Core User Stories

1. **As a knowledge worker**, I want to authenticate via OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect and access documents based on my assigned role permissions, so I can work securely within my authorized scope.[8][1][5]
2. **As a document editor**, I want to view and edit documents using BlockSuite's rich inline editor with real-time collaboration features, so I can efficiently update content with professional formatting.[9][10]
3. **As a researcher**, I want every document modification to automatically create a new version in Postgres with complete audit trails, so I can track changes and revert when necessary.[11][12][6]
4. **As a user**, I want to initiate reverse prompting to generate contextual research questions about my current document, so I can systematically explore related topics.[13]
5. **As a content creator**, I want to select generated questions and receive LLM-researched answers that become new linked documents, so I can expand my knowledge base systematically.[13]
6. **As an information architect**, I want to merge research content from subsidiary documents into primary documents using AI-assisted organization, so I can create comprehensive, enriched knowledge assets.[13]
7. **As a quality assurance user**, I want automated fact-checking and citation validation before finalizing merged content, so I can trust the accuracy and reliability of enriched documents.[13]
8. **As a system administrator**, I want comprehensive error handling with RFC 9457 Problem Details format and detailed audit logs, so I can monitor system health and debug issues efficiently.[14][15][2]

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security & Authentication:** Implement OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect for enterprise authentication. Deploy Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with granular document-level permissions supporting roles like Editor, Reviewer, Admin. Enforce input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Enable comprehensive audit logging of all CRUD operations, authentication events, and agent interactions.[16][4][17][1][2][8][3][14][5]
- **Performance & Scalability:** Target sub-200ms response times for document operations and sub-1s for version history retrieval. Support 10,000+ concurrent users with horizontal scaling capabilities. Implement efficient database indexing on document_id, version_number, and created_at columns. Use pagination for version history and search results (default 50 items per page).[4][7][18][2][6]
- **Reliability & Error Handling:** Achieve 99.9% uptime through stateless application design and managed database services. Implement standardized RFC 9457 Problem Details error responses with structured error codes, human-readable messages, and correlation IDs for debugging. Design graceful degradation when downstream services (LLM orchestrator, RAG) are unavailable.[19][20][15][21][14]
- **Data Integrity & Versioning:** Use Postgres as single source of truth with ACID compliance and referential integrity constraints. Implement optimistic locking for concurrent editing scenarios. Maintain complete version history with efficient storage and retrieval patterns.[12][6][11]

### üíª Technical Specification

#### System Architecture

**Architecture Pattern:** Service-oriented modular design with clean separation between presentation (Nuxt), business logic (Python/FastAPI), and persistence (Postgres) layers. Asynchronous communication with external AI orchestration services via message queues (RabbitMQ/Redis) for scalability and fault tolerance.[22][20][23][19]

**Communication Flow:**
- Nuxt frontend ‚Üî Python FastAPI backend (REST/JSON over HTTPS)
- FastAPI ‚Üî Postgres (direct connection with connection pooling)
- FastAPI ‚Üî Agent Orchestrator (async message queue for AI workflows)
- External services (Elasticsearch, Milvus, Neo4j) managed by separate microservices outside PRD_Questions scope

#### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Frontend | Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + BlockSuite | Existing ecosystem, SSR/SPA hybrid, enterprise-grade rich text editing[9][24][10] |
| Backend API | Python FastAPI + PydanticAI | High-performance async framework, automatic OpenAPI generation, robust validation[18][25] |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15+ | ACID compliance, advanced versioning support, excellent indexing capabilities[12][6][7] |
| Message Queue | RabbitMQ or Redis Streams | Reliable async communication for AI orchestration workflows[19][22][20] |
| Authentication | OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect | Enterprise security standards with JWT tokens[1][16][8] |
| Monitoring | Structured logging + APM | Real-time error tracking and performance monitoring[2][14] |

### Agents & SubAgents
#### Agent-Based Workflow 

- The subagent concept is a great idea, but the workflow needs a clearer definition for an IT team to implement it. This is the part that drives the "knowledge acceleration" value.
- Main Orchestrator Agent: This agent sits at the top and manages the overall workflow. Its job is to listen for user prompts (e.g., "Run a reverse prompt on this document") and delegate tasks to the appropriate subagents.
- Prompt Generation Subagent: This is the "secondary question's content" agent. It takes the user's current document as context and generates a list of relevant, insightful questions. It doesn't do the research itself.
- Researcher/Enhancer Subagent: This is the "research on a subtopic" agent. When the user selects a question, the orchestrator passes that question to this subagent. Its task is to perform the necessary research (e.g., by querying the RAG, using web searches, or other tools) and produce the new content.
- Document Organizer Subagent: The "merging content" agent. Once the researcher subagent returns new content, the orchestrator gives both the original document and the new content to this subagent. Its job is to intelligently merge and format the new information into the primary document. This is a crucial step to ensure the new content is seamlessly integrated.
- Checker Subagent: This is a key subagent for quality. It takes the newly enriched document and performs fact-checking, citation validation, and general quality control before the document is finalized.

#### Workflow Summary:

- User Action: User initiates a reverse prompt on Document A in PRD_Questions.
- Request to Backend: The Nuxt frontend sends a request to the Python backend.
- Orchestrator Trigger: The main orchestrator agent is triggered. It retrieves Document A from Postgres.
- Subagent Delegation: The orchestrator delegates Document A to the Prompt Generation Subagent.
- Question Generation: The Prompt Generation Subagent uses the LLM to generate a list of questions and sends them back to the UI.
- User Selection: The user selects Question Q1.
- New Delegation: The orchestrator delegates Question Q1 to the Researcher/Enhancer Subagent.
- Research and Retrieval: This subagent queries the RAG (Neo4j and Milvus via the RAG hybrid system) and potentially other tools to find a grounded answer.
- Document Creation: The new answer is instantiated as Document B, and a link is created in Postgres connecting Document B to Document A via Question Q1.
- Editing & Finalization: The user can edit Document B. When they save it, the rhoResearcher Embed job is triggered to reindex and vectorize it.
- Merging: If the user wants to merge Document B into Document A, the orchestrator invokes the Document Organizer Subagent to perform the content integration.
- Fact-Checking: The Halucination Checker Subagent can be run on the final merged document to validate the new information.
