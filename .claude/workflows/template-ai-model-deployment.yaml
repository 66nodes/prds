description: Deploy ML models with validation and monitoring

stages:
  - id: model_preparation
    agents:
      - ml-engineer
      - mlops-engineer
    tasks:
      - Validate model artifacts
      - Optimize for inference
      - Create serving container
    outputs: [model_container, serving_config]

  - id: infrastructure_setup
    agents:
      - cloud-architect
      - kubernetes-architect
    tasks:
      - Provision GPU nodes
      - Setup model registry
      - Configure load balancing
    outputs: [infrastructure_ready]

  - id: deployment
    agents:
      - mlops-engineer
      - deployment-engineer
    tasks:
      - Deploy to staging
      - Run inference tests
      - Setup A/B testing
    outputs: [staging_endpoint]

  - id: validation
    agents:
      - ml-engineer
      - data-scientist
    tasks:
      - Validate predictions
      - Check performance metrics
      - Monitor drift
    outputs: [validation_report]

  - id: production_rollout
    agents:
      - mlops-engineer
      - incident-responder
    tasks:
      - Gradual rollout
      - Monitor metrics
      - Setup alerts
    outputs: [production_endpoint]

monitoring:
  metrics:
    - inference_latency
    - throughput
    - accuracy
    - drift_score
  alerts:
    - latency > 100ms
    - accuracy < 0.95
    - drift_score > 0.1
