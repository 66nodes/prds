  draft_judge_integration:
    description: Test iterative refinement loop
    setup:
      - Create test requirements
      - Initialize mock GraphRAG
    tests:
      - name: basic_iteration
        steps:
          - Draft agent generates content
          - Judge agent evaluates
          - Verify feedback structure
          - Draft agent incorporates feedback
          - Judge agent approves
        assertions:
          - Iterations <= 3
          - Final quality > 0.90
          - No infinite loops
          
      - name: edge_case_handling
        scenarios:

          - Impossible constraints
          - Timeout scenarios
          - GraphRAG unavailable
