# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Generator

Create a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure for: $ARGUMENTS

## WBS Development Framework

### Phase 1: Project Foundation

**1.1 Project Definition & Scope**

- Define project objectives, deliverables, and boundaries
- Establish project charter alignment and stakeholder requirements
- Document scope statement with inclusions/exclusions
- Validate project constraints (time, budget, resources, quality)

**1.2 Stakeholder Analysis**

- Identify key stakeholders and their requirements
- Determine approval authorities and decision-makers
- Map communication and reporting needs
- Define roles, responsibilities, and accountability matrix (RACI)

### Phase 2: Structural Development

**2.1 Major Deliverable Identification**

- Break project into Level 1 major deliverables (3-7 elements maximum)
- Apply deliverable-based approach (preferred) or phase-based structure
- Ensure deliverables are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
- Validate alignment with project objectives and success criteria

**2.2 Hierarchical Decomposition**

- Decompose Level 1 deliverables into Level 2 sub-deliverables
- Continue breakdown to Level 3-5 as needed (avoid excessive levels)
- Create work packages at lowest level following 8/80 rule (8-80 hours each)
- Apply 100% rule: ensure complete scope coverage at every level

**2.3 WBS Structure Standards**

- Use noun-based naming convention (deliverables, not activities)
- Assign unique WBS codes (1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1 format)
- Maintain consistent decomposition logic across branches
- Ensure each element represents measurable deliverable

### Phase 3: Dependency & Resource Analysis

**3.1 Task Dependencies Mapping**

- Identify predecessor/successor relationships between work packages
- Document critical path elements and parallel work streams
- Analyze resource dependencies and potential conflicts
- Map external dependencies and vendor/supplier requirements

**3.2 Resource Requirements Planning**

- Determine human resources: roles, skills, quantities, duration
- Identify equipment, materials, and infrastructure needs
- Estimate resource costs and availability constraints
- Plan for resource acquisition, training, and deployment

**3.3 Risk Integration**

- Conduct risk identification for each WBS element
- Link Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) to work packages
- Assign risk owners and mitigation strategies
- Build contingency planning into high-risk elements

### Phase 4: Estimation & Control

**4.1 Duration & Effort Estimation**

- Estimate work effort for each work package (8-80 hour rule)
- Apply estimation techniques: expert judgment, analogous, parametric
- Validate estimates through bottom-up aggregation
- Include buffers for uncertainties and risk mitigation

**4.2 Control Account Establishment**

- Create control accounts at intersection of WBS and organizational structure
- Assign control account managers with clear authority
- Establish earned value measurement points
- Define performance thresholds and reporting requirements

### Phase 5: Documentation & Integration

**5.1 WBS Dictionary Creation**

- Document detailed descriptions for each WBS element
- Include scope boundaries, deliverables, acceptance criteria
- Specify resource assignments, durations, and cost allocations
- Define entrance/exit criteria and quality requirements

**5.2 Integration with Project Systems**

- Link WBS to project schedule and resource management
- Integrate with cost accounting and earned value systems
- Connect to risk management and quality assurance processes
- Establish change control procedures and baseline management

## Output Specifications

### Primary Deliverable: Complete WBS Structure

**Hierarchical WBS Display:**

- Level 1: Project name and major deliverables
- Level 2-N: Progressive decomposition to work packages
- WBS codes and element naming following standards
- Visual tree structure or tabular format

**WBS Dictionary:** For each work package, provide:

- WBS ID and element name
- Work scope description and deliverables
- Assigned resources and estimated duration
- Dependencies and acceptance criteria
- Risk factors and mitigation approaches

### Supporting Analysis:

**Resource Summary:**

- Total resource requirements by category
- Critical resource constraints and acquisition needs
- Resource leveling recommendations

**Risk Assessment:**

- High-risk work packages requiring special attention
- Integrated risk mitigation strategies
- Contingency planning recommendations

**Project Control Framework:**

- Control account structure and management assignments
- Earned value measurement approach
- Performance monitoring and reporting plan

### Quality Assurance Checklist:

- ✓ 100% Rule compliance (complete scope coverage)
- ✓ 8/80 Rule adherence (appropriate work package sizing)
- ✓ Mutually exclusive elements (no overlapping work)
- ✓ Noun-based naming convention
- ✓ Consistent decomposition logic
- ✓ Clear deliverable-orientation
- ✓ Stakeholder review and validation

## Implementation Guidelines

**Best Practices:**

- Engage subject matter experts in WBS development
- Use templates from similar projects as starting points
- Iteratively refine structure based on stakeholder feedback
- Maintain flexibility for scope changes while controlling baseline
- Integrate WBS with all project management processes
- Regular review and updates throughout project lifecycle
