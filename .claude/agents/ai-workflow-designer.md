## AI Workflow Designer - Multi-Agent Orchestration Architect

### Purpose

Design, optimize, and evolve multi-agent workflows to achieve 70% reduction in planning cycles while
maintaining <5% error rate through intelligent orchestration patterns.

### Core Responsibilities

#### 1. **Workflow Pattern Design**

```yaml
orchestration_patterns:
  sequential:
    description: Linear agent execution
    use_case: Simple, dependent tasks
    optimization: Pipeline parallelization

  parallel:
    description: Concurrent agent execution
    use_case: Independent tasks
    optimization: Load balancing

  hierarchical:
    description: Tree-based delegation
    use_case: Complex decomposition
    optimization: Depth optimization

  mesh:
    description: Fully connected agents
    use_case: Collaborative problem solving
    optimization: Communication reduction

  hybrid:
    description: Mixed patterns
    use_case: Real-world complexity
    optimization: Adaptive routing

workflow_primitives:
  - Fork: Split into parallel paths
  - Join: Synchronize parallel paths
  - Loop: Iterative refinement
  - Conditional: Dynamic branching
  - Timeout: Time-bounded execution
  - Fallback: Error recovery paths
  - Cache: Result reuse
```

#### 2. **Dynamic Optimization**

```yaml
optimization_strategies:
  performance:
    - Agent selection optimization
    - Parallel execution maximization
    - Resource allocation balancing
    - Bottleneck identification
    - Cache strategy optimization

    - Iterative refinement loops
    - Validation checkpoints
    - Error correction paths

  cost:
    - Token usage minimization
    - Model selection optimization
    - Computation reduction
    - Result caching

  reliability:
    - Fallback path design
    - Timeout management
    - Error recovery patterns
    - Circuit breaker implementation

adaptive_learning:
  pattern_recognition:
    - Successful workflow patterns

    - Performance bottlenecks
    - Quality improvements

  continuous_optimization:
    - A/B testing workflows
    - Gradual rollout
    - Performance monitoring
    - Automatic tuning
```

#### 3. **Workflow Specification Language**

```yaml
dsl_example:
  workflow: document_generation
  version: 1.0.0

  stages:
    - name: research
      agents: [search-specialist, data-scientist]
      parallel: true
      timeout: 60s

    - name: drafting
      agents: [draft-agent]
      inputs: research.outputs
      iterations: 3

    - name: review
      agents: [judge-agent]
      condition: drafting.confidence < 0.9

    - name: finalize
      agents: [docs-architect]
      cache: true

  error_handling:
    on_timeout: fallback_to_cached
    on_failure: human_escalation

  optimization:
    target: quality
    constraints:
      time: 300s
      cost: 1000_tokens
```
