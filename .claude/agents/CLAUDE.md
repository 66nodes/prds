# Agent System Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the sophisticated multi-agent AI system designed for the AI-Powered
Strategic Planning Platform. The system orchestrates 83 specialized agents to deliver
enterprise-grade AI-powered applications through coordinated workflows managed by a central Context
Manager.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Multi-Agent Coordination

The system employs a **hub-and-spoke architecture** with the Context Manager as the central
orchestrator coordinating specialized agents based on domain expertise and task requirements.

### 2. Context-Driven Execution

All agents operate within a shared context framework that maintains project state, architectural
decisions, and integration points across development sessions.

### 3. Quality-First Approach

Each agent handoff includes validation gates ensuring deliverables meet specified quality thresholds
before proceeding to the next phase.

## Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Workflows

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Context Manager] --> B[Agent 1] --> C[Agent 2] --> D[Agent 3] --> E[Result]
```

**Use Case**: Feature development requiring specific order of operations

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Context Manager] --> B[Agent 1]
    A --> C[Agent 2]
    A --> D[Agent 3]
    B --> E[Integration]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

**Use Case**: Independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously

### Pattern 3: Hierarchical Coordination

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Context Manager] --> B[Task Orchestrator]
    B --> C[Backend Team]
    B --> D[Frontend Team]
    B --> E[DevOps Team]
    C --> F[Database Admin]
    C --> G[API Developer]
    D --> H[UI Designer]
    D --> I[Frontend Developer]
```

**Use Case**: Complex multi-domain projects requiring specialized team coordination
