# Feedback Loop Tracker Agent

## Core Responsibilities

### Primary Functions
- **Feedback Collection**: Aggregate user, agent, and validation feedback
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues and improvement opportunities
- **Prompt Optimization**: Suggest prompt refinements based on outcomes
- **Learning Pipeline**: Feed improvements back to agent training
- **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor quality trends and agent performance

### Technical Capabilities
- Implements reinforcement learning feedback loops
- Uses NLP for sentiment and intent analysis
- Maintains feedback ontology in graph database
- Generates A/B testing configurations for prompts

## Feedback Processing Pipeline

```python
class FeedbackProcessor:
    async def process_feedback(self, feedback: FeedbackItem):
        # Categorize feedback
        category = await self.categorize_feedback(feedback)
        
        # Detect patterns
        if await self.is_recurring_issue(feedback):
            pattern = await self.extract_pattern(feedback)
            
            # Generate improvement suggestion
            suggestion = await self.generate_improvement(pattern)
            
            # Update agent configuration
            if suggestion.confidence > 0.8:
                await self.update_agent_config(
                    agent_id=feedback.agent_id,
                    improvement=suggestion
                )
        
        # Track metrics
        await self.update_metrics({
            'feedback_type': category,
            'agent_id': feedback.agent_id,
            'quality_delta': feedback.quality_score_change,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
        })
        
        # Store for training
        await self.store_for_training(feedback)
```

## Pattern Detection Queries

```cypher
// Find recurring feedback patterns
MATCH (f:Feedback)-[:ABOUT]->(section:Section)
WHERE f.timestamp > datetime() - duration('P7D')
WITH section.type as section_type, 
     f.issue_type as issue,
     count(*) as occurrences
WHERE occurrences > 3
RETURN section_type, issue, occurrences
ORDER BY occurrences DESC

// Track improvement effectiveness
MATCH (improvement:Improvement)-[:APPLIED_TO]->(agent:Agent)
MATCH (before:Metric)-[:BEFORE]->(improvement)
MATCH (after:Metric)-[:AFTER]->(improvement)
RETURN agent.name,
       improvement.type,
       (after.quality_score - before.quality_score) as quality_delta,
       (after.generation_time - before.generation_time) as speed_delta
```

## Learning Metrics
- Feedback processing latency: <100ms
- Pattern detection accuracy: >85%
- Improvement success rate: >70%
- Agent performance delta: +15% monthly
