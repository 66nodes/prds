      "expansionPrompt": "Break down monorepo initialization into: (1) pnpm workspace setup, (2) Nuxt.js project inclusion, (3) FastAPI project inclusion, (4) ESLint configuration with TypeScript strict mode, (5) Prettier setup, (6) SonarQube integration for CI, (7) Husky pre-commit hook setup.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a modern monorepo with pnpm, code quality tools, and CI integration is moderately complex due to cross-tool configuration, multi-language support, and the need for robust automation. Each tool (pnpm, ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube, Husky) requires separate configuration and validation, and best practices recommend clear separation of concerns and automated enforcement for code quality and CI/CD[1][3][4]."

      "reasoning": "While FastAPI is designed for rapid async API development, establishing a scalable, modular, and testable backend with microservices, validation, and testing requires careful planning and multiple configuration steps. Each aspect (async server, modularity, validation, testing) is a distinct subtask aligned with industry standards."

      "reasoning": "Human-in-the-loop validation in AI workflows is complex due to the need for seamless UI/UX, backend event tracking, integration with AI pipelines, and compliance/audit requirements. Each area is a separate subtask, and industry standards emphasize traceability and override capabilities for critical decisions."

      "reasoning": "Comprehensive audit logging and compliance reporting is high complexity due to the breadth of events, secure storage, retention, and regulatory requirements. Each logging and reporting aspect is a best-practice-driven subtask, and compliance testing is essential for industry standards."

      "reasoning": "Orchestrating 100+ specialized agents with context-aware selection, parallelism, and validation is highly complex. Each component (registry, selection, parallelism, validation, logging, error handling, testing) is a critical subtask, and robust orchestration is a recognized industry challenge."
